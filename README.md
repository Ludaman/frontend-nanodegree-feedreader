# Jeff Choate's Udacity Feedreader Test Suite project
============================
## Purpose
This project was developed to learn the Jasmine testing framework.  This project loads feedreader feeds from various feedreader sources asynchronously.  The application displays them to the webpage via callbacks.
## Running the Application
Simply download the git repository and load the index.html webpage. Scrolling to the bottom will show the results of the various unit tests.

If you would like to view the actual tests that run, you can load the javscript file within the  'jasmine' folder.
